# MagicUtilities

**MagicUtilities** is a lightweight Unity package with reusable tools to streamline common project needs. It’s modular, easy to drop in, and designed to grow over time.

## ✨ Features

### 🔁 Prefab Instancer

Ensures a list of prefabs is instantiated **once** across all scenes.

- Place this component in a scene.
- On load, it instantiates assigned prefabs **only once** (using a static flag).
- Auto-destroys itself if already initialized.

Great for shared systems like managers or pooled objects.

### 🎛️ CanvasGroup Updater

Simple component to **fade and toggle** a `CanvasGroup` from a boolean.

- Smoothly interpolates alpha using `lerpSpeed`.
- Updates `interactable` and `blocksRaycasts` accordingly.
- Call `UpdateValue(bool)` to show/hide the group.

---

### 🔊 Audio System (Basic)

Modular system for playing 2D/3D sounds using pooling and `ScriptableObject` configs.

- `AudioData` stores pitch/volume ranges, cooldowns, visibility checks, etc.
- `AudioManager` handles pooling, fading, spatialization, and track volumes.
- Use `AudioDataPlayer` to trigger sounds with a position reference.

Example:
```csharp
AudioManager.Instance.PlaySound(new AudioDataPlayer(myAudioData, transform.position));
```

### 🌐 Netcode (optional)

Drop-in components for **Netcode for GameObjects 2.x**: host, join (locally or online with Multiplayer Services), spawn players and sync simple objects without writing network code. Only compiled when NGO is installed.

`NetSession`, `NetSessionUI`, `NetPlayerSpawner`, `NetOwnerOnly`, `NetToggle`, `NetSingleUser`.

Setup and details: [NETCODE.md](NETCODE.md).
